# Eigensphere

Graphical visualizer of 3 dimensional eigenvectors

Code takes an input matrix A and scales it with vectors modeling a unit sphere.
The matrix can be any of dimension 3x3 or less, with empty dimension filled in with 0.

eigencheck.m is used in V1 only, it finds the angles between to vectors

V1 is a 2-dimensional variant used to test the concept, has minimal commenting

V2 is a prototype of V3, functional works but has an extremely high runtime

V3 is the commented final version

Code is entirely my own and was written during the Winter of 2018.
During this project I learned more about coordinate systems, plotting techniques, and what eigenvectors and values actually look like. Project was inspired by my calc IV professor who showed a pre-calculated demonstration of a 2-D visualizer. My V1 is different as it is calculates the eigenvectors in real time geometrically rather than beforehand.
